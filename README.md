# JimStudio

## Purpose
A client, Jim Felder, came to me and wanted a website to showcase his art work.  The website allows him to add and delete paintings.  He also can display a flag when a painting is sold.  Visitors also have the ability to filter through different types of work by the use of tags that Jim Felder assigns for each work.  

## Technology
I decided to use Vue for a frontend.  Vue adds interactivity to the user.  I used Laravel/PHP backend.  InertiaJS communicates between both frontend and backend.  The application uses MySQL as the database.
